#kMailQueue

Simple Mail Queue for Kohana 3.x which utilises a database table, connected with ORM.

## Requirements

- Kohana 3.x (3.0 or 3.1)
- Kohana ORM
- Kohana Email extension (https://github.com/banks/kohana-email)

## Usage

TBD.

## Known Issues

- Being developed under Kohana 3.0.10 so not quite sure on 3.1 compatibility. Finished module will be compatible with both.
